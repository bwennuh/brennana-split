            <p id="gettoknow">Get to know me! :)</p>
            <p class="aboutme">Like I mentioned before, I am a short, blonde vegan who lives for ice cream and Lightning McQueen.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">I am 28 (going on 29 soon!) and have recently decided to switch career paths.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Virginia (WaHooWa, Class of 2014!), as I wanted to design roller coasters. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get a job as a roller coaster designer (as apparently those jobs aren't as necessary as some), and so I ended up going into the Architecture/Engineering (AE) industry.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">I worked at 3 different MEP consulting engineering firms, working on a variety of building designs in the DC Metro area. And while some projects were super cool, I just never truly felt passionate about doing HVAC design. I mean, don't get me wrong - proper ventilation is super important. But... it's not roller coasters.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">So, I decided it was time to start trying something new!</p>
