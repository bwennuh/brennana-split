        <div id="gettoknowme">
            <p id="gettoknow">Get to know me! :)</p>
            <p class="aboutme">Like I mentioned before, I am a short, blonde vegan who lives for ice cream and Lightning McQueen.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">I am 28 (going on 29 soon!) and have recently decided to switch career paths.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Virginia (WaHooWa, Class of 2014!), as I wanted to design roller coasters. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get a job as a roller coaster designer (as apparently those jobs aren't as necessary as some), and so I ended up going into the Architecture/Engineering (AE) industry.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">I worked at 3 different MEP consulting engineering firms, working on a variety of building designs in the DC Metro area. And while some projects were super cool, I just never truly felt passionate about doing HVAC design. I mean, don't get me wrong - proper ventilation is super important. But... it's not roller coasters.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">So to quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Carrera">Sally Carrera</a> here, "And you know what? It never felt happy."</p>
            <p class="aboutme">There was one main thing in the engineering world that spoke to me, and that was 3D modeling. I have a love for BIM and Revit that goes above most people's heads, and have previously joked with colleagues that my goal was to just work with Revit (or rather, Autodesk) some day.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">If you haven't heard of <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>, I highly recommend giving them a look. They create some of the coolest modeling software around, and Autodesk Inventor is one of the main things that first got me into engineering. And you know what software and apps always need? Software engineers and developers.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">So, I decided it was time to start trying something new! I had tried for a long while to make HVAC design work for me, but ultimately it just wasn't meant to be. I craved freedom for creatitivy. I craved being challenged on new things every day. And most importantly, I craved being passionate about my job again.</p>
